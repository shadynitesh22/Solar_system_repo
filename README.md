Hi , Thank you so much for the opportunity you guys provided.
This was a good Experience. I had a hard time understanding the question.
I have studied science till my 10th grade so finding mass was so confusing when i searched it in google.
I was very confused of how will display it in the forntend.
First I made a graphic illustration of solar system.
Plugin in data from backend to animations was new to me.
That took most time and decided I would display in cards format.

The function of finding exo planets which by definition is planets just in space or not in our solar system.
I decided to add a bollen filed , so if it exists in solar system it is false it not it is true

I found the distance by using period years.

@Due to me taking more time -- Submission was on friday -- Due to janaipurnima I was occupied.<br>
@I am sorry for taking time as I'm studying masters , My semester is ending, so I had a lot of work<br>
@<br>
Note these are not excuses: Even thou candidate is selected , I would like to you look at it and give me some verdict.<br>@<br>
I have a model planets and solar system models has a many-to-many relationship planets, I was thinking I will write a condition where it checks if the planets exist in solar system.
